# connect6 game
Connect6 is a strategic two-player game inspired by classics like Connect 4 and Go Moku. Played on a grid (commonly a 19x19 board), players alternate turns placing two stones per move, except for the first player, who starts with one stone only. The goal is to form a line of six consecutive stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
